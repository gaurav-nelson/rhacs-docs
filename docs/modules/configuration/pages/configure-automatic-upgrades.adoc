You can automate the upgrade process for each secured cluster and view the upgrade status from the RHACS portal.

Automatic upgrades make it easier to stay up-to-date by automating the manual task of upgrading each secured cluster.

With automatic upgrades, after you upgrade Central;  Sensor, Collector, and Compliance services in all secured clusters, automatically upgrade to the latest version.

{product-title} also enables centralized management of all your secured clusters from within the RHACS portal.
The new *Clusters* view displays information about all your secured clusters, the Sensor version for every cluster, and upgrade status messages.
You can also use this view to selectively upgrade your secured clusters or change their configuration.

[NOTE]
====
* The automatic upgrade feature is enabled by default.
* If you are using a private image registry, you must first push the Sensor and Collector images to your private registry.
* The Sensor must run with the default RBAC permissions.
* Automatic upgrades do not preserve any patches that you have made to any {product-title} services running in your cluster.
However, it preserves all labels and annotations that you have added to any {product-title} object.
* By default, {product-title} creates a service account called `sensor-upgrader` in each secured cluster.
This account is highly privileged but is only used during upgrades.
If you remove this account, Sensor does not have enough permissions, and you must complete future upgrades manually.
