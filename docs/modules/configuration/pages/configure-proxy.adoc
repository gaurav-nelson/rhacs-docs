If your network configuration restricts outbound traffic through proxies, you can configure proxy settings in {product-title} to route traffic through a proxy.

When you use a proxy with {product-title}:

* All outgoing HTTP, HTTPS, and other TCP traffic from Central and Scanner goes through the proxy.
* Traffic between Central and Scanner does not go through the proxy.
* The proxy configuration does not affect the other {product-title} components.
* When you are not using the offline mode, and a Collector running in a secured cluster needs to download an additional kernel module or eBPF probe at runtime:
** The collector attempts to download them by contacting Sensor.
** The Sensor then forwards this request to Central.
** Central uses the proxy to locate the module or probe at `\https://collector-modules.stackrox.io`.
