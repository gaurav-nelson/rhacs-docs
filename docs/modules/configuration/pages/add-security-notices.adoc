With {product-title}, you can add security notices that users see when they log in.
You can also set up an organization-wide message or disclaimers on the top or bottom of the RHACS portal.

This message can serve as a reminder of corporate policies and notify employees of the appropriate policies.
Alternatively, you might want to display these messages for legal reasons, for example, to warn users that their actions are audited.
