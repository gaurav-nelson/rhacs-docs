= Pereodic scanning of images

[role="_abstract"]
{product-title} periodically scans all active images and updates the image scan results to reflect the latest vulnerability definitions. Active images are the images you have deployed in your environment.

[NOTE]
====
From {product-title} 3.0.57, you can enable automatic scanning of inactive images by configuring the *Watch* setting for images.
====

Central fetches the image scan results for all active images from Scanner or other integrated image scanners that you use and updates the results every 4 hours.

You can also use the `roxctl` CLI to check the image scan results on demand.
