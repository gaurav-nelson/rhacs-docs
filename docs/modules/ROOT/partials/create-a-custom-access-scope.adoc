You can create new access scopes from the *Access Control* view.

.Prerequisites
* You must have the *Admin* role, or a role with the permission set with read and write permissions for the `AuthProvider` and `Role` resources to create, modify, and delete permission sets.

.Procedure
. On the RHACS portal, navigate to *Platform Configuration* -> *Access control*.
. Select the *Access scope* tab.
. Click *Add access scope*.
. Enter a *Name* and *Description* for the new access scope.
. Under the *Allowed resources* section:
** Use the *Cluster filter* and *Namespace filter* boxes to filter the list of clusters and namespaces visible in the list.
** Expand the *<Cluster_name>* to see the list of namespaces in that cluster.
** Turn on the toggle under the *Manual selection* column for a cluster to allow access to all namespaces in that cluster.

[NOTE]
====
Access to a specific cluster provides users with access to the following resources within the scope of the cluster:

* {ocp} or Kubernetes cluster metadata and security information
* Compliance information for authorized clusters
* Node metadata and security information
* Acess to all namespaces in that cluster and their associated security information
====
** Turn on the toggle under the *Manual selection* column for a namespace to allow access to that namespace.
+
[NOTE]
====
Access to a specific namespace gives access to the following information within the scope of the namespace:

* Alerts and violations for deployments
* Vulerability data for images
* Deployment metadata and security information
* Role and user information
* Network graph, policy, and baseline information for deployments
* Process information and process baseline configuration
* Prioritized risk information for each deployment
====
. If you want to allow access to clusters and namespaces based on labels, click *Add label selector* under the *Label selection rules* section. Then click *Add rules* to specify *Key* and *Value* pairs for the label selector. You can specify labels for clusters and namespaces.
. Click *Save*.
