= Configuring endpoints during a new installation

When you install {product-title} by using the `roxctl` CLI, it creates a folder named `central-bundle`, which contains the necessary YAML manifests and scripts to deploy Central.

.Procedure
. After you generate the `central-bundle`, open the `./central-bundle/central/02-endpoints-config.yaml` file.
. In this file, add your custom YAML configuration under the `data:` section of the key `endpoints.yaml`.
Make sure that you maintain a 4 space indentation for the YAML configuration.
. Continue the installation instructions as usual.
{product-title} uses the specified configuration.

[NOTE]
====
If you expose any additional ports other than the default port `8443`, you must create network policies that allow traffic on those additional ports.
