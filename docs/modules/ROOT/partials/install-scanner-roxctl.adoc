You can configure {product-title} to obtain image data from a variety of open-source and commercial image scanners.
//Link to image scanners topic

However, {product-title} also provides an image vulnerability scanner component, called Scanner. It enriches deployments with image vulnerability information.

Red Hat recommends deploying Scanner so that it can scan all images, including the images from public registries, for vulnerabilities.
You can deploy the Scanner in the same cluster with Central.

.Prerequisites
* You must configure your image registry to allow Scanner to download and scan images. Usually, image registry integrations are created automatically by {product-title}.
//See Image Registry integration for the details.

.Procedure
. Run the following command to configure image registry access:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ./central-bundle/scanner/scripts/setup.sh
----
. After the script finishes, run the following command to create the scanner service:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -R -f central-bundle/scanner
----
