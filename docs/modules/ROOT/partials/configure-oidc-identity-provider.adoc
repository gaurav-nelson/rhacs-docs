= Configuring an OIDC identity provider in {product-title}

You can configure {product-title} to use your OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider.

.Prerequisites
* You must have already configured an application in your identity provider, such as Google Workspace.
* You must have permissions to configure identity providers in {product-title}.

.Procedure
. On the RHACS portal, navigate to *Platform Configuration* -> *Access Control*.
. Open the *Add an Auth Provider* menu and select *OpenID Connect*.
. Fill out the details for:
** *Integration Name*: A name to identify your authentication provider.
For example, *Auth0* or *Google Workspace*". The integration name is shown on the login page to help users select the right sign-in option.
** *Callback Mode*: Select *HTTP POST* (default).
An alternative mode called _Fragment_, designed around the limitations of Single Page Applications (SPAs), is also available.
Red Hat only supports the _Fragment_ mode for legacy integrations, and does not recommended using it for new integrations.
** *Issuer*: The root URL of your identity provider, for example `\https://accounts.google.com` for Google Workspace.
See your identity provider documentation for more information.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you are using {product-title} version 3.0.49 and newer, for *Issuer* you can:

* Prefix your root URL with `https+insecure://` to skip TLS validation.
This configuration is insecure and Red Hat does not recommended it.
Only use it for testing purposes.
* Specify query strings, for example, `?key1=value1&key2=value2` along with the root URL.
{product-title} appends the value of *Issuer* as is to the authorization endpoint.
You can use it to customize your provider's login screen.
For example, you can optimize the Google Workspace login screen to a specific hosted domain by using the  link:https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/openid-connect#hd-param[`hd` parameter], or pre-select an authentication method in PingFederate by using the link:https://docs.pingidentity.com/bundle/pingfederate-93/page/nfr1564003024683.html[`pfidpadapterid` parameter].
====
** *Client ID*: The OIDC Client ID for your configured project.
. Choose a *Minimum access role* for users accessing {product-title} by using the selected identity provider.
+
[TIP]
====
Set the *Minimum access role* to *Admin* while you complete setup.
Later, you can return to the *Access Control* page to set up more tailored access rules based on user metadata from your identity provider.
====
. Click *Save*.

.Verification
. On the RHACS portal, navigate to *Platform Configuration* -> *Access Control*.
. Select the *Auth Provider Rules* tab.
. Under the *Auth Providers* section, select the authentication provider that you want to verify the configuration for.
. Select *Test Login* from the *Auth Provider* section header.
The *Test Login* page opens in a new browser tab.
. Sign in with your credentials.
** On success, {product-title} shows the `User ID` and `User Attributes` the identity provider sent for the credentials you have used to log in.
** On failure, {product-title} shows a message describing why the identity provider's response could not be processed.
. Close the *Test Login* browser tab.
