[id="enable-traffic-flow-through-custom-ports_{context}"]
= Enabling traffic flow through custom ports

If you are exposing a port to another service running in the same cluster or to an ingress controller, you must only allow traffic from the services in your cluster or from the proxy of the ingress controller.
Otherwise, if you are exposing a port by using a load balancer service, you might want to allow traffic from all sources, including external sources. Use the procedure listed in this section to allow traffic from all sources.

.Procedure
. Clone the `allow-ext-to-central` Kubernetes network policy:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n stackrox get networkpolicy.networking.k8s.io/allow-ext-to-central -o yaml > <directory_path>/allow-ext-to-central-custom-port.yaml
----
. Use it as a reference to create your network policy, and in that policy, specify the port number you want to expose.
Make sure to change the name of your network policy in the `metadata` section of the YAML file, so that it does not interfere with the built-in `allow-ext-to-central` policy.
