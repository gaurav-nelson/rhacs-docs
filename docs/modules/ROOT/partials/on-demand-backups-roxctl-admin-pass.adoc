= On-demand backups by using the administrator password

[role="_abstract"]
You can back up the entire database of {product-title} by using your administrator password.

.Prerequisites

* You must have the administrator password.
* You must have installed the `roxctl` CLI.

.Procedure

. Set the `CENTRAL_ADDRESS` environment variable:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export CENTRAL_ADDRESS=<address>:<port_number>
----
. Run the `backup` command:
* For {product-title} 3.0.55 or later:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ roxctl -p <admin_password> -e "$CENTRAL_ADDRESS" central backup
----
* For {product-title} 3.0.54 or older:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ roxctl -p <admin_password> -e "$CENTRAL_ADDRESS" central db backup
----

By default, the `roxctl` CLI saves the backup file in the directory in which you run the command.
You can use the `--output` option to specify the backup file location.
