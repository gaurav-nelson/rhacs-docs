= Sending alerts to different Slack channels

[role="_abstract"]
You can configure {product-title} to send notifications to different Slack channels so that they directly go to the right team.


.Procedure
. After you configure incoming webhooks, add an annotation similar to the following in your deployment YAML file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
example.com/slack-webhook: https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
----
. Use the annotation key `example.com/slack-webhook` in the *Label/Annotation Key For Slack Webhook* field when you configure {product-title}.

After the configuration is complete, if a deployment has the annotation that you configured in the YAML file, {product-title} sends the alert to the webhook URL you specified for that annotation. Otherwise, it sends the alert to the default webhook URL.
