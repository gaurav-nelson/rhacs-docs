You can turn off the enforcement on relevant policies, which in turn instructs the admission controller to skip enforcements.

.Procedure
. On the RHACS portal, navigate to *Platform Configuration* -> *System Policies*.
. Disable enforcement on the default policies:
** In the policies view, scroll down and select the power icon next to the *Kubernetes Actions: Exec into Pod* policy to disable that policy.
** In the policies view, scroll down and select the power icon next to the *Kubernetes Actions: Port Forward to Pod* policy to disable that policy.
. Disable enforcement on any other custom policies that you have created by using criteria from the default *Kubernetes Actions: Port Forward to Pod* and *Kubernetes Actions: Exec into Pod* policies.
