= Event timeline section

[role="_abstract"]
The *Event Timeline* section in the *Process Discovery* tab provides an overview of events for the selected deployment.
It shows the number of policy violations, process activities, and container termination or restart events.

You can select *Event Timeline* to view more details.

The *Event Timeline* modal box shows events for all pods for the selected deployment.

The events on the timeline are categorized as:

* Process activities
* Policy violations
* Container restarts
* Container terminations

The events appear as icons on a timeline.
To see more details about an event, hold your mouse pointer over the event icon.
The details appear in a tooltip.

* Click *Show Legend* to see which icon corresponds to which type of event.
* Select *Export* -> *Download PDF* or *Export* -> *Download CSV* to download the event timeline information.
* Select the *Show All* drop-down menu to filter which type of events are visible on the timeline.
* Click on the expand icon to see events separately for each container in the selected pod.

All events in the timeline are also visible in the minimap control at the bottom.
The minimap controls the number of events visible in the event timeline.
You can change the events shown in the timeline by modifying the highlighted area on the minimap.
To do this, decrease the highlighted area from left or right sides (or both), and then drag the highlighted area.

[NOTE]
====
* When containers restart, {product-title}:
** Shows information about container termination and restart events for up to 10 inactive container instances for each container in a pod.
For example, for a pod with two containers `app` and `sidecar`, {product-title} keeps activity for up to 10 `app` instances and up to 10 `sidecar` instances.
** Does not track process activities associated with the previous instances of the container.
* {product-title} only shows the most recent execution of each (process name, process arguments, UID) tuple for each pod.
* {product-title} shows events only for the active pods.
* {product-title} adjusts the reported timestamps based on time reported by Kubernetes and the Collector.
Kubernetes timestamps use second-based precision, and it rounds off the time to the nearest second.
However, the Collector uses more precise timestamps.
For example, if Kubernetes reports the container start time as `10:54:48`, and the Collector reports a process in that container started at `10:54:47.5349823`, {product-title} adjusts the container start time to `10:54:47.5349823`.
