= Using the roxctl CLI

Review the following sections to learn how to complete common tasks using the CLI.

[NOTE]
====

* Export the following variables before using these commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export ROX_API_TOKEN=<api_token>
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export ROX_CENTRAL_ADDRESS=<address>:<port_number>
----

* You can use the `--help` option to get more information about the commands.
====

[id="manage-central-db_{context}"]
== Managing Central's database
Central stores information about:

* Activity observed in your clusters,
* Information retrieved from integrated image registries  or scanners, and
* {product-title} configuration.
//TODO Add links to registries and scanners

You can back up and restore Central's database by using the `roxctl` CLI.

[discrete]
=== Backing up Central database

Run the following command to back up Central's database:
[source,terminal]
----
$ roxctl -e "$ROX_CENTRAL_ADDRESS" central backup
----

[discrete]
=== Restoring Central database

Run the following command to restore Central's database:
[source,terminal]
----
$ roxctl -e "$ROX_CENTRAL_ADDRESS" central db restore <backup_filename>
----

[id="manage-secure-clusters_{context}"]
== Managing secured clusters

To secure a Kubernetes or an {ocp} cluster, you must deploy {product-title} services into the cluster.
You can generate deployment files in the RHACS portal by navigating to the *Platform Configuration* -> *Clusters* view, or you can use the `roxctl` CLI.

[discrete]
=== Generating Sensor deployment YAML file

.Kubernetes

[source,terminal]
----
$ roxctl -e "$ROX_CENTRAL_ADDRESS" sensor generate k8s --name <cluster_name> --central "$ROX_CENTRAL_ADDRESS"
----

.{ocp}

[source,terminal]
----
$ roxctl -e "$ROX_CENTRAL_ADDRESS" sensor generate openshift --name <cluster_name> --central "$ROX_CENTRAL_ADDRESS"
----

Read the `--help` output to see other options that you might need to use depending on your system architecture.

Make sure that the endpoint you provide for `--central` can be reached from the cluster where you are deploying {product-title} services.

[NOTE]
====
If you are using a non-gRPC capable LoadBalancer, such as HAProxy, AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB), or AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB):

* Use the WebSocket Secure (`wss`) protocol.
To use `wss`, prefix the address with *`wss://`*, and
* Add the port number after the address, for example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ roxctl sensor generate k8s --central wss://stackrox-central.example.com:443
----
====

[discrete]
=== Downloading Sensor bundle for existing clusters

Use the following command to download Sensor bundles for existing clusters by specifying a cluster name or ID.

[source,terminal]
----
$ roxctl sensor get-bundle <cluster_name_or_id>
----

[discrete]
=== Deleting cluster integration

[source,terminal]
----
$ roxctl -e "$ROX_CENTRAL_ADDRESS" cluster delete --name=<cluster_name>
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Deleting cluster integration will not remove {product-title} services running in the cluster.
You can remove them by running the `delete-sensor.sh` script from the Sensor installation bundle.
====

[id="check-policy-compliance_{context}"]
== Checking policy compliance

[discrete]
=== Checking deployment YAML files

The following command checks build-time and deploy-time violations of your security policies in YAML deployment files.
//TODO: Add link to security policies section
Use this command to validate:

* Configuration options in a YAML file, such as resource limits or privilege options;
or
* Aspects of the images used in a YAML file, such as components or vulnerabilities.

[source,terminal]
----
$ roxctl -e "$ROX_CENTRAL_ADDRESS" deployment check --file=<yaml_filename>
----

[discrete]
=== Checking images

The following command checks build-time violations of your security policies in images.
//TODO: Add link to security policy section
[source,terminal]
----
$ roxctl -e "$ROX_CENTRAL_ADDRESS" image check --image=<image_name>
----

[discrete]
=== Checking image scan results

You can also check the scan results for specific images.

The following command returns the components and vulnerabilities found in the image in JSON format.
The format is defined in the API reference.
//TODO: Add link to the API reference.

[source,terminal]
----
$ roxctl -e "$ROX_CENTRAL_ADDRESS" image scan --image <image_name>
----

To cause {product-title} to re-pull image metadata and image scan results from the associated registry and scanner, add the `--force` option.

[NOTE]
====
To check specific image scan results, you must have a token with both `read` and `write` permissions for the `Image` resource.
The default *Continuous Integration* system role already has the required permissions.
//TODO: Add link to the system role topic.
====

[id="debug-issues_{context}"]
== Debugging issues

[discrete]
=== Managing Central log level

Central saves information to its container logs.

[discrete]
==== Viewing the logs
You can see the container logs for Central by running:

.Kubernetes
[source,terminal]
----
$ kubectl logs -n stackrox <central_pod>
----

.{ocp}
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc logs -n stackrox <central_pod>
----

[discrete]
==== Viewing current log level
You can change the log level to see more or less information in Central logs.
Run the following command to view the current log level:
[source,terminal]
----
$ roxctl -e "$ROX_CENTRAL_ADDRESS" central debug log
----

[discrete]
==== Changing the log level
Run the following command to change the log level:

[source,terminal]
----
$ roxctl -e "$ROX_CENTRAL_ADDRESS" central debug log --level=<log_level> <1>
----
<1> The acceptable values for `<log_level>` are `Panic`, `Fatal`, `Error`, `Warn`, `Info`, and `Debug`.

[discrete]
=== Retrieving debugging information

To gather debugging information for investigating issues, run the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ roxctl -e "$ROX_CENTRAL_ADDRESS" central debug dump
----
