= Risk view

[role="_abstract"]
The *Risk* view lists all deployments from all clusters, sorted by a multi-factor risk metric based on policy violations, image contents, deployment configuration, and other similar factors.
Deployments at the top of the list present the most risk.

The *Risk* view shows list of deployments with following attributes for each row:

* *Name*: The name of the deployment.
* *Created*: The creation time of the deployment.
* *Cluster*: The name of the cluster where the deployment is running.
* *Namespace*: The namespace in which the deployment exists.
* *Priority*: A priority ranking based on severity and risk metrics.

In the *Risk* view, you can:

* Select a column heading to sort the violations in ascending or descending order.
* Use the filter bar to filter violations.
//See the link:/docs/search/#use-local-page-filtering[Use local page filtering] topic for more information.
* Create a new policy based on the filtered criteria.

To view more details about the risks for a deployment, select a deployment in the *Risk* view.
