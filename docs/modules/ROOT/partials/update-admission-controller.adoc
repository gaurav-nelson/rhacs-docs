= Updating Admission Controller

[role="_abstract"]
{product-title} 3.0.55 includes changes that affect admission controller integration. Therefore, if you are using an admission controller or want to take advantage of the admission controller integrationâ€™s new features, you must run some additional commands to upgrade the secured cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are upgrading from a {product-title} version between 3.0.44 and 3.0.54, and you are not using an Admission Controller and automatic upgrades, then you must manually redeploy Sensor on all clusters.
====

.Prerequisites

* You must be using the {product-title} Admission Controller. To check if you are using the Admission Controller, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get validatingwebhookconfiguration stackrox
----
+
If you get an error, it means that you are not using an admission controller.

.Procedure

. Delete the existing validating webhook configuration:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete validatingwebhookconfiguration stackrox
----
+
[TIP]
====
If you want to allow any additional admission controller features moving forward, navigate to the *Clusters* configuration view on the RHACS portal, select the cluster you are updating, and enable the appropriate options.
====
. Obtain a new Sensor bundle for the secured cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ roxctl sensor get-bundle <cluster_name>
----
. Unzip the Sensor bundle and open the extracted directory.
. Create the `admission-control` deployment and related objects:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n stackrox apply -f admission-controller-scc.yaml
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n stackrox apply -f admission-controller-secret.yaml
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n stackrox apply -f admission-controller-rbac.yaml
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n stackrox apply -f admission-controller-netpol.yaml
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n stackrox apply -f admission-controller-pod-security.yaml
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n stackrox apply -f admission-controller.yaml
----

[WARNING]
====
By default, the `--listenOnEvents` option is set to `false` during the upgrade. It controls the deployment of the admission controller webhook, which listens for `exec` and `portforward` events. If you are using {ocp} version 3.11, do not set the `--listenOnEvents` option to `true`. Since these events are not available for {ocp} 3.11, enabling them causes errors.
