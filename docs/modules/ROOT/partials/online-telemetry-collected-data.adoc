* *{product-title} components health information*: Details about {product-title} components versions, their memory usage, and any reported errors.
* *Coarse-grained usage statistics*: Details about API endpoint invocation counts and reported error statuses.
It does not include the actual data sent in API requests.

It includes kernel and operating system versions, resource pressure, and taints.
* *Environment information*: Details about each secured cluster, including Kubernetes or {ocp} version, Istio version (if applicable), cloud provider type and other similar information.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The collection frequency is once every 24 hours.
However, if there are any performance-related events, such as rapidly increasing error counts or new errors, {product-title} increases this frequency up to once every hour.
Once sufficient information is gathered to resolve the issues, the frequency changes back to once every 24 hours.
