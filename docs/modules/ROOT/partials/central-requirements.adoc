= Prerequisites for installing Central

A single containerized service called Central handles data persistence, API interactions, and user interface (Portal) access.

Central requires persistent storage:

* You can provide storage with a persistent volume claim (PVC).
+
[NOTE]
====
You can use a hostPath volume for storage only if all your hosts (or a group of hosts) mount a shared file system, such as an NFS share or a storage appliance.
Otherwise, your data is only saved on a single node. Red Hat does not
recommend using a hostPath volume.
====
* Use Solid-State Drives (SSD) for best performance.
However, you can use another storage type if you do not have SSDs available.

[NOTE]
====
For security reasons, you should deploy Central in a cluster with limited administrative access.
