System logs depend on the size of your environment.
For large deployments, data includes log files for components with critical errors only, such as a high restart count.
* YAML definitions for {product-title} components: This data does not include Kubernetes secrets.

* Online Telemetry data, which includes:
** Storage information: Details about the database size and the amount of free space available in attached volumes.
** {product-title} components health information: Details about {product-title} components versions, their memory usage, and any reported errors.
** Coarse-grained usage statistics: Details about API endpoint invocation counts and reported error statuses.
It does not include the actual data sent in API requests.
