= Prerequisites for adding custom certificates

.Prerequisites

* You must already have PEM-encoded private key and certificate files.
* The certificate file should begin and end with human-readable blocks. For example:
+
[source,text]
----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIICLDCCAdKgAwIBAgIBADAKBggqhkjOPQQDAjB9MQswCQYDVQQGEwJCRTEPMA0G
...
l4wOuDwKQa+upc8GftXE2C//4mKANBC6It01gUaTIpo=
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
----
* The certificate file can contain either a single (leaf) certificate, or a certificate chain.
+
[WARNING]
====
* If the certificate is not directly signed by a trusted root, you must provide the full certificate chain, including any intermediate certificates.
* All certificates in the chain must be in order so that the leaf certificate is the first and the root certificate is the last in the chain.
====
* If you are using a custom certificate that is not globally trusted, you must also configure the Sensor to trust your custom certificate.
