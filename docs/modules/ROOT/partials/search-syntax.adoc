= Search syntax

A search query is made up of two parts:

* An attribute that identifies the resource type you want to search for.
* A search term that finds the matching resource.

For example, to find all violations in the `visa-processor` deployment, the search query is `Deployment:visa-processor`. In this search query, `Deployment` is the attribute and `visa-processor` is the search term.

[NOTE]
====
You must select an attribute before you can use search terms. However, in some views, such as the *Risk* view and the *Violations* view, {product-title} automatically applies the relevant attribute based on the search term you enter.
====

* You can use multiple attributes in your query. When you use more than one attribute, the results only include the items that match all attributes.
+
.Example
When you search for `Namespace:frontend CVE:CVE-2018-11776`, it returns only those resources which violate CVE-2018-11776 in the `frontend` namespace.

* You can use more than one search term with each attribute. When you use more than one search term, the results include all items that match any of the search terms.
+
.Example
If you use the search query `Namespace: frontend backend`, it returns matching results from the namespace `frontend` or `backend`.

* You can combine multiple attribute and search term pairs.
+
.Example
The search query `Cluster:production Namespace:frontend CVE:CVE-2018-11776` returns all resources which violate CVE-2018-11776 in the `frontend` namespace in the `production` cluster.

* Search terms can be part of a word, in which case {product-title} returns all matching results.
+
.Example
If you search for `Deployment:def`, the results include all deployments starting with `def`.

* To explicitly search for a specific term, use the search terms inside quotes.
+
.Example
When you search for `Deployment:"def"`, the results only include the deployment `def`.

* You can also use regular expressions by using `r/` before your search term.
+
.Example
When you search for `Namespace:r/st.*x`, the results include matches from namespace `stackrox` and `stix`.

* Use `!` to indicate the search terms that you do not want in results.
+
.Example
If you search for `Namespace:!stackrox`, the results include matches from all namespaces except the `stackrox` namespace.

* Use the comparison operators `>`, `<`, `=`, `>=`, or `\<=` to match a specific value or range of values.
+
.Example
If you search for `CVSS:>=6`, the results include all vulnerabilities with Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score 6 or higher.
