= Viewing network policies

[role="_abstract"]
Network policies specify how groups of pods are allowed to communicate with each other and with other network endpoints.
Kubernetes `NetworkPolicy` resources use labels to select pods and define rules that specify what traffic is allowed to or from the selected pods.
{product-title} discovers and displays network policy information for all your Kubernetes clusters, namespaces, deployments, and pods, in the *Network Graph* view.

To view network policies and other related details for deployments in a namespace, you can select the namespace in *Network Graph* view.

The namespace details panel lists all deployments in the selected namespace.
You can then hover over a deployment in the details panel and select the *Navigate to deployment* (arrow) icon that appears on the right to view deployment details.

Alternatively, you can directly select a deployment in the *Network Graph* view to view its details.
The deployment details panel includes the *Network Flows*, *Details*, and *Network Policies* tabs.

You can select each tab to view related information.

* The *Network Flows* tab shows information about ingress and egress connections, protocols, and port numbers in use for that deployment.
* The *Details* tab shows information about how the service is deployed, including orchestrator labels and annotations.
* The *Network Policies* tab shows information about every network policy that applies to the deployment.

[NOTE]
====
You need {product-title} version 3.0.47 or newer to see information about ingress and egress connections, protocols, port numbers, and the direction of the network traffic.
