= Creating an Okta app

Before you can use Okta as a SAML 2.0 identity provider for {product-title}, you must create an Okta app.

[WARNING]
====
Okta's *Developer Console* does not support the creation of custom SAML 2.0 applications.
If you are using the *Developer Console*, you must first switch to the *Admin Console* (*Classic UI*).
To switch, click *Developer Console* in the top left of the page and select *Classic UI*.
====

.Prerequisites
* You must have an account with administrative privileges for the Okta portal.

.Procedure
. On the Okta portal, select *Applications* from the menu bar.
. Click *Add Application* and then select *Create New App*.
. In the *Create a New Application Integration* dialog box, leave *Web* as the platform and select *SAML 2.0* as the protocol that you want to sign in users.
. Click *Create*.
. On the *General Settings* page, enter a name for the app in the *App name* field.
. Click *Next*.
. On the *SAML Settings* page, set values for the following fields:
.. *Single sign on URL*
*** Specify it as `\https://<RHACS_portal_hostname>/sso/providers/saml/acs`.
*** Leave the *Use this for Recipient URL and Destination URL* option checked.
*** If your RHACS portal is accessible at different URLs, you can add them here by checking the *Allow this app to request other SSO URLs* option and add the alternative URLs using the specified format.
.. *Audience URI (SP Entity ID)*
*** Set the value to *RHACS* or another value of your choice.
*** Remember the value you choose; you will need this value when you configure {product-title}.
.. *Attribute Statements*
*** You must add at least one attribute statement.
*** Red Hat recommends using the email attribute:
**** *Name:* email
**** *Format:* Unspecified
**** *Value:* user.email
. Verify that you have configured at least one *Attribute Statement* before continuing.
. Click *Next*.
. On the *Feedback* page, select an option that applies to you.
. Select an appropriate *App type*.
. Click *Finish*.

After the configuration is complete, you are redirected to the *Sign On* settings page for the new app.
A yellow box contains links to the information that you need to configure {product-title}.

After you have created the app, assign Okta users to this application.
Go to the *Assignments* tab, and assign the set of individual users or groups that can access {product-title}.
For example, assign the group *Everyone* to allow all users in the organization to access {product-title}.
