= Using network baselining

[role="_abstract"]
In {product-title}, you can minimize your risks by using network baselining.
It is a proactive approach to keep your infrastructure secure.
{product-title} first discovers existing network flows and creates a baseline, and then it treats network flows outside of this baseline as anomalous.

[NOTE]
====
* To use the *Network baseline* feature, you must use the {product-title} version 3.0.54 or newer.
* To enable alerts on baseline violations, you must use {product-title} version 3.0.56 or newer.
====

When you install {product-title}, there is no default network baseline.
As {product-title} discovers network flows, it creates a baseline and then it adds all discovered network flows to it.

* When {product-title} discovers new network activity, it adds that network flow to the network baseline.
* Network flows do not show up as anomalous flows and do not trigger any violations.

After the discovery phase:

* {product-title} stops adding network flows to the network baselines.
* New network flows (which are not in the network baseline) show up as anomalous flows but they do not trigger any violations.
