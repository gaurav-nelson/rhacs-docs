= Policy generation strategy

When you autogenerate network policies:

* {product-title} generates a single network policy for each deployment in the namespace.
The pod selector for the policy is the pod selector of the deployment.
** If a deployment already has a network policy, {product-title} does not generate new policies or delete existing policies.
* Generated policies only restrict traffic to existing deployments.
** Deployments you create later will not have any restrictions unless you create or generate new network policies for them.
** If a new deployment needs to contact a deployment with a network policy, you might need to edit the network policy to allow access.
* Each policy has the same name as the deployment name, prefixed with `stackrox-generated-`.
For example, the policy name for the deployment `depABC` in the generated network policy is `stackrox-generated-depABC`.
All generated policies also have an identifying label.
* {product-title} generates a single rule allowing traffic from any IP address if:
** The deployment has an incoming connection from outside the cluster within the selected time, or
** The deployment is exposed through a `NodePort` or `LoadBalancer` service.
* {product-title} generates one `ingress` rule for every deployment from which there is an incoming connection.
** For deployments in the same namespace, this rule uses the pod selector labels from the other deployment.
** For deployments in different namespaces, this rule uses a namespace selector.
To make this possible, {product-title} automatically adds a label, `namespace.metadata.stackrox.io/name`, to each namespace.

[IMPORTANT]
====
In rare cases, if a standalone pod does not have any labels, the generated policy allows traffic from or to the pod's entire namespace.
