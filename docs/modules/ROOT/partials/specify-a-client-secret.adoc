= Specifying a client secret

{product-title} version 3.0.39 and newer supports the link:https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/authorization-code/[OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant] authentication flow when you specify a client secret.
When you use this authentication flow, {product-title} uses a refresh token to keep users logged in beyond the token expiration time configured in your OIDC identity provider.

When users log out, {product-title} deletes the refresh token from the client-side.
Additionally, if your identity provider API supports refresh token revocation, {product-title} also sends a request to your identity provider to revoke the refresh token.

You can specify a client secret when you configure {product-title} to integrate with an OIDC identity provider.

[NOTE]
====
* You cannot use a *Client Secret* with the _Fragment_ *Callback mode*.
* You cannot edit configurations for existing authentication providers.
* You must create a new OIDC integration in {product-title} if you want to use a *Client Secret*.
====

Red Hats recommends using a client secret when connecting {product-title} with an OIDC identity provider.
If you do not want to use a *Client Secret*, you must select the *Do not use Client Secret (not recommended)* option.
