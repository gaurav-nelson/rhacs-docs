= Reissuing internal certificates for Central

Central uses a built-in server certificate for authentication when communicating with other {product-title} services.
This certificate is unique to your Central installation.
The RHACS portal shows an information banner when the Central certificate is about to expire.

[NOTE]
====
The information banner only appears 15 days before the certificate expiry date.

.Prerequisites

* To reissue certificates, you must have `write` permission for the `ServiceIdentity` resource.

.Procedure

. Click on the link in the banner to download a YAML configuration file, which contains a new {ocp} secret, including the certificate and key values.
. Apply the new YAML configuration file to the cluster where you have installed Central.
