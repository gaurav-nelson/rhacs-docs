= Finding policy violations

[role="_abstract"]
The *Policy Violations by Severity* widget in the *Configuration Management* view displays policy violations in a sunburst chart.
Each level of the chart is represented by one ring or circle.

* The innermost circle represents the total number of violations.
* The next ring represents the *Low*, *Medium*, *High*, and *Critical* policy categories.
* The outermost ring represents individual policies in a particular category.

The *Configuration Management* view only shows the information about policies that have the *Lifecycle Stage* set to *Deploy*.
It does not include policies that address runtime behavior or those configured for assessment in the *Build* stage.

.Procedure
. Navigate to the RHACS portal and click *Configuration Management* from the left-hand navigation menu.
. On the *Policy Violations by Severity* widget, move your mouse over the sunburst chart to view details about policy violations.
. Select *_n_ rated as high*, where _n_ is a number, to view detailed information about high-priority policy violations.
The *Policies* view displays a list of policy violations filtered on the selected category.
. Select a row to view more details, including policy description, remediation, deployments with violations, and more.
The details are visible in a panel.
. The *Policy Findings* section in the information panel lists deployments where these violations occurred.
. Select a deployment under the *Policy Findings* section to view related details including Kubernetes labels, annotations, service account, and violation comments and tags.

You can use the detailed information to plan a remediation for violations.
