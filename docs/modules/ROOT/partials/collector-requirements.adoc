= Prerequisites for installing Collector
Collector monitors runtime activity on each node in your secured clusters.
It connects to Sensor to report this information.

[CAUTION]
====
To install Collector on systems configured with Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) boot, you must use eBPF probes because kernel modules are unsigned, and the UEFI firmware cannot load unsigned packages.

== Memory and storage requirements

|===
| Collector | CPU | Memory

| *Request*
| .05 cores
| 320 MiB

| *Limit*
| .75 cores
| 1 GiB
|===

[NOTE]
====
Collector uses a mutable image tag (`<version>-latest`), so you get support for newer Linux kernel versions more easily.
There is no change in code, pre-existing kernel modules, or eBPF programs for image updates.
Updates only add a single image layer with support for new kernel versions published after the initial release.
