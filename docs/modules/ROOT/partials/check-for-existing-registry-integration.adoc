= Checking for existing registry integration

You can use the RHACS portal to check if you have already integrated with a registry.

.Procedure
. On the RHACS portal, navigate to *Platform Configuration* -> *Integrations*.
. Under the *Image Integration* section, look for highlighted *Registry* tiles.
The tiles also list the number of items already configured for that tile.

If none of the Registry tiles are highlighted, you must first integrate with an image registry.
