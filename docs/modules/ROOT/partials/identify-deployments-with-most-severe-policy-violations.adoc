= Identifying deployments with most severe policy violations

The *Deployments with most severe policy violations* widget on the *Vulnerability Management* view shows a list of deployments and severity of vulnerabilities affecting that deployment.

* When you hover over a deployment in the list, you see an overview of the deployment, which includes the deployment name, the name of the cluster and the namespace in which the deployment exists, and the number of failing policies and their severity.
* When you select a deployment, the *Deployment* view opens for the selected deployment.
The *Deployment* view shows in-depth details of the deployment and includes information about policy violations, common vulnerabilities, CVEs, and riskiest images for that deployment.
* Select *View All* on the *Most Common Vulnerabilities* widget header to view a list of all the CVEs in your infrastructure.
You can also filter the list of CVEs.
//TODO: Add link to local page filtering
To export the CVEs as a CSV file, select *Export* -> *Download CVES as CSV*.
