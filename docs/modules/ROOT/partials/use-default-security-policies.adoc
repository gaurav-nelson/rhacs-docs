= Using default security policies

[role="_abstract"]
{product-title} includes a set of default policies that provide broad coverage to identify security issues and ensure best practices for security in your environment.

To view the default policies:

* On the RHACS portal, navigate to *Platform Configuration* -> *System policies*.

The *Policies* view lists the default policies and includes the following parameters for each policy:

* *Name*: A short name for the policy.
* *Description*: A longer, more detailed description of the alert for the policy.
* *Lifecycle*: Corresponds to the phase of the container lifecycle (build, deploy, or runtime) that this policy applies to, and the phase at which enforcement will be applied, when the policy is enabled.
* *Severity*: A ranking of the policy, either critical, high, medium, or low, for the amount of attention required.

The default policies have preconfigured parameters and belong to categories such as:

* Anomalous Activity
* Cryptocurrency Mining
* DevOps Best Practices
* Kubernetes
* Network Tools
* Package Management
* Privileges
* Security Best Practices
* System Modification
* Vulnerability Management

You can edit these categories create your own categories.
