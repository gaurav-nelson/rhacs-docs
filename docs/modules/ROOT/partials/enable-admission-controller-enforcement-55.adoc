= Enabling admission controller enforcement in {product-title} version 3.0.55 and newer

[role="_abstract"]
You can enable admission controller enforcement from the *Clusters* view when you install Sensor or edit an existing cluster configuration.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Beginning from {product-title} version 3.0.55.0, the admission controller webhook is deployed into the cluster by default.
====

.Procedure
. On the RHACS portal, navigate to *Platform Configuration* -> *Clusters*.
. Select an existing cluster from the list or select *+ New Cluster*.
. In the cluster configuration panel, enter the details for your cluster.
. Red Hat recommends that you only turn on the *Configure Admission Controller Webhook to listen on creates* toggle if you are planning to use the admission controller to enforce on object create events.
. Red Hat recommends that you only turn on the *Configure Admission Controller Webhook to listen on updates* toggle if you are planning to use the admission controller to enforce on update events.
. Red Hat recommends that you only turn on the *Enable Admission Controller Webhook to listen on exec and port-forward events* toggle if you are planning to use the admission controller to enforce on pod execution and pod port forwards events.
. Configure the following options:
** *Enforce on Object Creates*: This toggle controls the behavior of the admission control service.
You must have the *Configure Admission Controller Webhook to listen on creates* toggle turned on for this to work.
** *Enforce on Object Updates*: This toggle controls the behavior of the admission control service.
You must have the *Configure Admission Controller Webhook to listen on updates* toggle turned on for this to work.
. Select *Next*.
. In the *Download files* section, select *Download YAML Files and Keys*.

[NOTE]
====
When enabling admission controller for an existing cluster, if you make any changes in the:

* *Static Configuration* section, you must download the YAML files and redeploy the Sensor.
* *Dynamic Configuration* section, you can skip downloading the files and deployment, as {product-title} automatically syncs the Sensor and applies the changes.
====
. Select *Finish*.

.Verification
* After you provision a new cluster with the generated YAML, run the following command to verify if admission controller enforcement is configured correctly:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get ValidatingWebhookConfiguration <1>
----
<1> Use `kubectl` instead of `oc` if you are using Kubernetes.
+
.Example output
