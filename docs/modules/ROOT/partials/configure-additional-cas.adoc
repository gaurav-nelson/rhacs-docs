.Procedure

. Download the link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/openshift-docs/rhacs-docs/files/ca-setup.sh[`ca-setup.sh`] script.
+
[NOTE]
====
* If you are doing a new installation, you can find the `ca-setup.sh` script in the `scripts` directory at `central-bundle/central/scripts/ca-setup.sh`.
* You must run the `ca-setup.sh` script in the same terminal from which you logged into your {ocp} cluster.
====
. Make the `ca-setup.sh` script executable:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ chmod +x ca-setup.sh
----
. To add:
.. A single certificate, use the `-f` (file) option:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ./ca-setup.sh -f <certificate>
----
+
[NOTE]
====
* You must use a PEM-encoded certificate file (with any extension).
* You can also use the `-u` (update) option along with the `-f` option to update any previously added certificate.
====
.. Multiple certificates at once, move all certificates in a directory, and then use the `-d` (directory) option:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ./ca-setup.sh -d <directory_name>
----
+
[NOTE]
====
* You must use PEM-encoded certificate files with a `.crt` extension.
* Each file must only contain a single certificate.
* You can also use the `-u` (update) option along with the `-d` option to update any previously added certificates.
