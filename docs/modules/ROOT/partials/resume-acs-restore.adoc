= Resuming the restore operation

[role="_abstract"]
During a restore operation, if your connection is interrupted or you need to go offline, you can resume the restore operation.

* If you do not have access to the machine running the resume operation, use the `roxctl central db restore status` command to check the status of an ongoing restore operation.
* In case of connection interruptions, the `roxctl` CLI automatically tries to restore a task when the connection becomes available.
The automatic connection retries depend on the duration specified by the `timeout` option.
* Use the `--timeout` option to specify the time in seconds, minutes, or hours, after which the `roxctl` CLI stops trying to resume a restore operation.
If not specified, the default timeout is 10 minutes (`10m`).
* If a restore operation is stuck or if you want to cancel it, use the `roxctl central db restore cancel` command to cancel an ongoing restore operation.
* If a restore operation is stuck, or you have canceled it, or it timed out, you can resume the previous restore by re-running the original command.

[NOTE]
====
* During interruptions, {product-title} caches an ongoing restore operation for 24 hours.
You can resume this operation by re-running the original restore command.
* The `--timeout` option only governs client-side connection retries and does not affect the 24 hours server-side restore cache.
* You cannot resume restore operations across restarts of the Central pod.
* If a restore operation is interrupted, you must restart it within 24 hours and before Central restarts, otherwise {product-title} cancels the restore operation.
