= Authenticating using the roxctl CLI

For authentication, you can use an authentication token or your administrator password.
Red Hat recommends using an authentication token in a production environment because each token is assigned specific access control permissions.
//TODO: Add links to role based access control

Use the following steps to generate an authentication token.

.Procedure

. Navigate to the RHACS portal.
. Go to *Platform Configuration* -> *Integrations*.
. Scroll down to the *Authentication Tokens* category, and click *API Token*.
. Click *Generate Token*.
. Enter a name for the token and select a role that provides the required level of access (for example, *Continuous Integration* or *Sensor Creator*).
. Click *Generate*.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Copy the generated token and securely store it.
You will not be able to view it again.
====

[NOTE]
====
After you have generated the authentication token, export it as `ROX_API_TOKEN` variable:
[source,terminal]
----
$ export ROX_API_TOKEN=<api_token>
----
You can also save the token in a file and use it with the `--token-file` option.
For example:
[source,terminal]
----
$ roxctl central debug dump --token-file <token_file>
----

* You cannot use both the `-password` (`-p`) and the `--token-file` options simultaneously.
* If you have already set `ROX_API_TOKEN` variable, and specify the `--token-file` option, the `roxctl` CLI uses the specified token file for authentication.
* If you have already set `ROX_API_TOKEN` variable, and specify the `--password` option, the `roxctl` CLI uses the specified password for authentication.
