= Using global search

By using global search you can search across all resources in your environment. Based on the resource type you use in your search query, the results are grouped in the following categories:

* All (Lists matching results across all categories.)
* Violations
* Policies
* Deployments
* Images
* Secrets

These categories are listed as a table on the RHACS portal global search page and you can click on the category name to identify results belonging to the selected category.

To do a global search, in the RHACS portal, select *Search* on the top right side.
