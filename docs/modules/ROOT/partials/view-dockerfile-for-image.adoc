= Viewing the Dockerfile for an image

Use the *Vulnerability Management* view to find the root cause of vulnerabilities in an image.
You can view the Dockerfile and find exactly which command in the Dockerfile introduced the vulnerabilities and all components that are associated with that single command.

The Dockerfile tab shows information about:

* All the layers in the Dockerfile
* The instructions and their value for each layer
* The components included in each layer
* The number of CVEs in components for each layer

When there are components introduced by a specific layer, you can select the expand icon to see a summary of its components.
If there are any CVEs in those components, you can select the expand icon for an individual component to get more details about the CVEs affecting that component.

.Procedure

. Navigate to the RHACS portal and click *Vulnerability Management* from the navigation menu.
. Select an image from the *Top Riskiest Images* widget.
. In the *Image* details view, select the *Dockerfile* tab under the *Image Findings* section.
