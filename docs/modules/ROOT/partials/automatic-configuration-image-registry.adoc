[role="_abstract"]
{product-title} includes default integrations with standard registries, such as Docker Hub and others.
{product-title} also automatically configures integrations based on image pull secrets in the monitored clusters.
Usually, you do not need to manually configure registry integrations.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you use registries like GCR and ECR, and have your clusters set up to pull images using node IAM (Identity and Access Management) instead of image pull secrets, {product-title} does not create a registry integration automatically.
For such cases you must manually configure your image registries.
