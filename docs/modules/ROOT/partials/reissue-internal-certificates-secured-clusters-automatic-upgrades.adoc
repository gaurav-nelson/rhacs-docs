= Reissuing internal certificates for secured clusters by using automatic upgrades

You can reissue internal certificates for Sensor, Collector, and Admission Controller by using automatic upgrades.

.Prerequisites

* You must have enabled automatic upgrades for all clusters.
* To reissue certificates, you must have `write` permission for the `ServiceIdentity` resource.

.Procedure

. In the RHACS portal, navigate to *Platform Configuration* -> *Clusters*.
. In the *Clusters* view, select a *Cluster* to view its details.
. From the cluster details panel, select the link to *apply credentials by using an automatic upgrade*.

[NOTE]
====
When you apply an automatic upgrade, {product-title} creates new credentials in the selected cluster. However, you will still see a notification. The notification goes away when each {product-title} service begins using the new credentials after the service restarts.
