= Custom roles

{product-title} also allows you to create custom roles.
You can create a custom role with one or more permissions and then grant that custom role to users.
Creating custom roles enables you to enforce the principle of least privilege (PoLP).
You can use these roles to give users or system accounts only those permissions that are essential to performing their intended functions.
