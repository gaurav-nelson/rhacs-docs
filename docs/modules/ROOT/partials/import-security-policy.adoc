= Importing a security policy

[role="_abstract"]
You can import a security policy from the *System Policies* view on the RHACS portal.

.Procedure
. On the RHACS portal, navigate to *Platform Configuration* -> *System policies*.
. On the *Policies* view header, select *Import Policy* and select the file you want to upload.

Each security policy in {product-title} has a unique ID (UID) and a unique name.
When you import a policy, {product-title} handles the uploaded policy as follows:

* If the imported policy UID and name do not match any existing policy, {product-title} creates a new policy.
* If the imported policy has the same UID as an existing policy, but a different name, you can either:
** Keep both policies.
{product-title} saves the imported policy with a new UID.
** Replace the existing policy with the imported policy.
* If the imported policy has the same name as an existing policy, but a different UID, you can either:
** Keep both policies by providing a new name for the imported policy.
** Replace the existing policy with the imported policy.
* If the imported policy has the same name and UID as an existing policy, the {product-title} checks if the policy criteria match to the existing policy.
If the policy criteria match, {product-title} keeps the existing policy and shows a success message.
If the policy criteria do not match, you can either:
** Keep both policies by providing a new name for the imported policy.
** Replace the existing policy with the imported policy.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* If you import into the same Central instance, {product-title} uses all the exported fields.
* If you import into a different Central instance, {product-title} omits certain fields, such as cluster scopes, cluster exclusions, and notifications.
{product-title} shows these omitted fields in a message.
These fields vary for every installation, and you cannot migrate them from one Central instance to another.
