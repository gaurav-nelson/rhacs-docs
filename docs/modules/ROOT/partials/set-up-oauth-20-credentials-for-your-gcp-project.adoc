= Setting up OAuth 2.0 credentials for your GCP project

To configure Google Workspace as an identity provider for {product-title}, you must first configure OAuth 2.0 credentials for your GCP project.

.Prerequisites
* You must have administrator-level access to your organization's Google Workspace account to create a new project, or permissions to create and configure OAuth 2.0 credentials for an existing project. Red Hat recommends that you create a new project for managing access to {product-title}.

.Procedure
. Create a new Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project, see the Google documentation topic link:https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects[creating and managing projects].
. After you have created the project, open the link:https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials[*Credentials*] page in the Google API Console.
. Verify the project name listed in the upper left corner near the logo to make sure that you are using the correct project.
. To create new credentials, go to *Create Credentials* -> *OAuth client ID*.
. Choose *Web application* as the *Application type*.
. In the *Name* box, enter a name for the application, for example, *RHACS*.
. In the *Authorized redirect URIs* box, enter `\https://<stackrox_hostname>:<port_number>/sso/providers/oidc/callback`.
** replace `<stackrox_hostname>` with the hostname on which you expose your  Central instance.
** replace `<port_number>` with the port number on which you expose Central.
If you are using the standard HTTPS port `443`, you can omit the port number.
. Click *Create*.
This creates an application and credentials and redirects you back to the credentials page.
. An information box opens, showing details about the newly created application.
Close the information box.
. Copy and save the *Client ID* that ends with `.apps.googleusercontent.com`.
You can check this client ID by using the Google API Console.
. Select *OAuth consent screen* from the navigation menu on the left.

[NOTE]
====
The OAuth consent screen configuration is valid for the entire GCP project, and not only to the application you created in the previous steps.
If you already have an OAuth consent screen configured in this project and want to apply different settings for {product-title} login, create a new GCP project.
====
. On the OAuth consent screen page:
.. Choose the *Application type* as *Internal*.
If you select *Public*, anyone with a Google account can sign in.
.. Enter a descriptive *Application name*.
This name is shown to users on the consent screen when they sign in.
For example, use *RHACS* or *<organization_name> SSO for {product-title}*.
.. Verify that the *Scopes for Google APIs* only lists *email*, *profile*, and *openid* scopes.
Only these scopes are required for single sign-on.
If you grant additional scopes it increases the risk of exposing sensitive data.
