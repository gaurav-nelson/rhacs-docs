= Custom YAML configuration

[role="_abstract"]
{product-title} uses the YAML configuration as a `ConfigMap`, making configurations easier to change and manage.

When you use the custom YAML configuration file, you can configure the following for each endpoint:

* The protocols to use, such as `HTTP`, `gRPC`, or both.
* Enable or disable TLS.
* Specify server certificates.
* Client Certificate Authorities (CA) to trust for client authentication.
* Specify if client certificate authentication (`mTLS`) is required.

You can use the configuration file to specify endpoints either during the installation or on an existing instance of {product-title}.
However, if you expose any additional ports other than the default port `8443`, you must create network policies that allow traffic on those additional ports.

The following is a sample `endpoints.yaml` configuration file for {product-title}:

[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
# Sample endpoints.yaml configuration for Central.
#
# # CAREFUL: If the following line is uncommented, do not expose the default endpoint on port 8443 by default.
# #          This will break normal operation.
# disableDefault: true # if true, do not serve on :8443 <1>
endpoints: <2>
  # Serve plaintext HTTP only on port 8080
  - listen: ":8080" <3>
    # Backend protocols, possible values are 'http' and 'grpc'. If unset or empty, assume both.
    protocols: <4>
      - http
    tls: <5>
      # Disable TLS. If this is not specified, assume TLS is enabled.
      disable: true <6>
  # Serve HTTP and  gRPC for sensors only on port 8444
  - listen: ":8444" <3>
    tls: <5>
      # Which TLS certificates to serve, possible values are 'service' (For  service certificates that {product-title} generates)
      # and 'default' (user-configured default TLS certificate). If unset or empty, assume both.
      serverCerts: <7>
        - default
        - service
      # Client authentication settings.
      clientAuth: <8>
        # Enforce TLS client authentication. If unset, do not enforce, only request certificates
        # opportunistically.
        required: true <9>
        # Which TLS client CAs to serve, possible values are 'service' (CA for service
        # certificates that {product-title} generates) and 'user' (CAs for PKI auth providers). If unset or empty, assume both.
        certAuthorities: <10>
        # if not set, assume ["user", "service"]
          - service
----
<1> Use `true` to disable exposure on the default port number `8443`.
The default value is `false`; changing it to `true` might break existing functionality.
<2> A list of additional endpoints for exposing Central.
<3> The address and port number on which to listen. You must specify this value if you are using `endpoints`.
You can use the format `port`, `:port`, or `address:port` to specify values.
For example,
* `8080` or `:8080` - listen on port `8080` on all interfaces.
* `0.0.0.0:8080` - listen on port `8080` on all IPv4 (not IPv6) interfaces.
* `127.0.0.1:8080` - listen on port `8080` on the local loopback device only.
<4> Protocols to use for the specified endpoint.
Acceptable values are `http` and `grpc`.
If you do not specify a value, Central listens to both HTTP and gRPC traffic on the specified port.
If you want to expose an endpoint exclusively for the RHACS portal, use `http`.
However, you will not be able to use the endpoint for service-to-service communication or for the `roxctl` CLI, because these clients require both gRPC and HTTP.
Red Hat recommends that you do not specify a value of this key, to enable both HTTP and gRPC protocols for the endpoint.
If you want to restrict an endpoint to {product-title} services only, use the *clientAuth* option.
<5> Use it to specify the TLS settings for the endpoint.
If you do not specify a value, {product-title} enables TLS with the default settings for all the following nested keys.
<6> Use `true` to disable TLS on the specified endpoint.
The default value is `false`.
When you set it to `true`, you cannot specify  values for `serverCerts` and `clientAuth`.
<7> Specify a list of sources from which to configure server TLS certificates.
The `serverCerts` list is order-dependent, it means that the first item in the list determines the certificate that Central uses by default, when there is no matching SNI (Server Name Indication).
You can use this to specify multiple certificates and Central automatically selects the right certificate based on SNI.
Acceptable values are:
* `default`: use the already configured custom TLS certificate if it exists.
* `service`: use the internal service certificate that  {product-title} generates.
<8> Use it to configure the behavior of the TLS-enabled endpoint's client certificate authentication.
<9> Use `true` to only allow clients with a valid client certificate.
The default value is `false`.
You can use `true` in conjunction with a the `certAuthorities` setting of `service` to only allow {product-title} services to connect to this endpoint.
<10> A list of CA to verify client certificates. The default value is `["service", "user"]`.
The `certAuthorities` list is order-independent, it means that the position of the items in this list does not matter.
Also, setting it as empty list `[]` disables client certificate authentication for the endpoint, which is different from leaving this value unset.
Acceptable values are:
* `service`: CA for service certificates that {product-title} generates.
* `user`: CAs configured by PKI authentication providers.
