= System health dashboard details

To access the health dashboard:

* On the RHACS portal, navigate to *Platform Configuration* -> *System Health*.

The health dashboard organizes information in the following groups:

* *Cluster Health* - Shows the overall state of {product-title} cluster.
* *Vulnerability Definitions* - Shows the last update time of vulnerability definitions.
* *Image Integrations* - Shows the health of all registries that you have integrated.
* *Notifier Integrations*  - Shows the health of any notifiers (Slack, email, Jira, or other similar integrations) that you have integrated.
* *Backup Integrations* - Shows the health of any backup providers that you have integrated.

The dashboard lists the following states for different components:

* *Healthy* - The component is functional.
* *Degraded* - The component is partially unhealthy.
This state means the cluster is functional, but some components are unhealthy and require attention.
* *Unhealthy* - This component is not healthy and requires immediate attention.
* *Uninitialized* - The component has not yet reported back to Central to have its health assessed.
An uninitialized state may sometimes require attention, but often components report back the health status after a few minutes or when the integration is used.

== Cluster health section

The *Cluster Overview* shows information about your {product-title} cluster health.
It reports the health information about the following:

* *Collector Status* - It shows whether the Collector pod that {product-title} uses is reporting healthy.
* *Sensor Status* - It shows whether the Sensor pod that {product-title} uses is reporting healthy.
* *Sensor Upgrade* - It shows whether the Sensor is running the correct version when compared with Central.
* *Credential Expiration*  - It shows if the credentials for {product-title} are nearing expiration.

[NOTE]
====
Clusters in the `Uninitialized` state are not reported in the number of clusters secured by {product-title} until they check in.

== Vulnerabilities definition section

The *Vulnerabilities Definition* section shows the last time vulnerability definitions were updated and if the definitions are up to date.

[discrete]
== Integrations section

There are 3 integration sections *Image Integrations*,  *Notifier Integrations*, and *Backup Integrations*.
Similar to the *Cluster Health* section, these sections list the number of unhealthy integrations if they exist.
Otherwise, all integrations report as healthy.

[NOTE]
====
The *Integrations* section lists the healthy integrations as `0` if any of the following conditions are met:

* You have not integrated {product-title} with any third-party tools.
* You have integrated with some tools, but disabled the integrations, or have not set up any policy violations.
