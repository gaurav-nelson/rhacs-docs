For deploying Central, use a machine type with 4 or more cores and apply scheduling policies to launch Central on such nodes.

** Use Solid-State Drives (SSDs) for best performance.
However, you can use another storage type if you do not have SSDs available.
* Helm command-line interface (CLI) v3.2 or newer.
Use the `helm version` command to verify the version of Helm you have installed.
* The {ocp} CLI (`oc`).

If you are not a Red Hat customer and purchased the Stackrox Kubernetes Security Platform before the acquisition, you can use StackRoxâ€™s container registry at `stackrox.io`. Contact mailto:support@stackrox.com[support@stackrox.com] to enable access to the registry.
