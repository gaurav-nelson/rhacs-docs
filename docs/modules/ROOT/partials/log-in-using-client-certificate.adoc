= Logging in by using a client certificate

After you configure PKI authentication, users see a certificate prompt on the RHACS portal login page.
The prompt only shows up if a client certificate trusted by the configured root CA is installed on the user's system.

Use the procedure described in this section to log in by using a client certificate.

.Procedure
. Open the RHACS portal.
. Select a certificate in the browser prompt.
. On the login page, select the authentication provider name option to log in with a certificate.
If you do not want to log in by using the certificate, you can also log in by using the administrator password or another login method.

[NOTE]
====
Once you use a client certificate to log into the RHACS portal, you cannot log in with a different certificate unless you restart your browser.
