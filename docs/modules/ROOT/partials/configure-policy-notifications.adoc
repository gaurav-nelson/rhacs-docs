. Click *Enable*.

[NOTE]
====
* {product-title} sends notifications on an opt-in basis.
To receive notifications, you must first assign a notifier to the policy.
* Notifications are only sent once for a given alert.
If you have assigned a notifier to a policy, you will not receive a notification unless a violation generates a new alert.

* {product-title} creates a  new alert when:
** A policy violation occurs for the first time in a deployment.
** A runtime-phase policy violation occurs in a deployment after you resolved the previous runtime alert for a policy in that deployment.
