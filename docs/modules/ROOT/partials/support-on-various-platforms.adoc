[id="support-on-various-platforms_{context}"]
= Support on various platforms

[role="_abstract"]
The StackRox support team supports a platform version based on the upstream (or vendor) productâ€™s support lifecycle for that version. When support for a platform version reaches its end of life (EOL) or is not actively maintained, StackRox no longer supports it.

[WARNING]
====
StackRox does not support:

* Installing the StackRox Kubernetes Security Platform on Minikube and other similar single-node clusters.
* Amazon Elastic File System (EFS). Use Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) with the default GP2 volume type instead.
* Older CPUs that do not have the Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE) 4.2 instruction set, for example Intel processors older than Sandy Bridge and AMD processors older than Bulldozer. Both of these processors were released in 2011.
