= Running a compliance scan

[role="_abstract"]
Running a compliance scan checks the compliance status for your entire infrastructure across all compliance standards.
When you run a compliance scan, {product-title} takes a data snapshot of your environment.
The data snapshot includes alerts, images, network policies, deployments, and related host-based data.
Central collects the host-based data from the Sensors running in your clusters.
After that, Central collects more data from the compliance container running in each collector pod.
The compliance container collects the following data about your environment:

* Configurations for Docker Daemon, Docker image, and Docker container.
* Information about Docker networks.
* Command-line arguments and processes for Docker, Kubernetes, and {ocp}.
* Permissions of specific file paths.
* Configuration files for the core Kubernetes and {ocp} services.

After the data collection is complete, Central performs checks on the data to determine results.
You can view the results from the compliance dashboard and also generate compliance reports based on the results.

[NOTE]
====
In a compliance scan:

* *Control* describes a single line item in an industry or regulatory compliance standard against which an auditor evaluates an information system for compliance with said standard.
{product-title} checks the evidence of compliance with a single control by completing one or more checks.
* *Check* is the single test performed during a single control assessment.
* Some controls have multiple checks associated with them.
If any of the associated check fails for a control, the entire control state is marked as `Fail`.
