= Configuring a SAML 2.0 identity provider in {product-title}

Use the instructions in this section to integrate a SAML 2.0 identity provider with {product-title}.

.Prerequisites
* You must have permissions to configure identity providers in {product-title}.
* You must have an Okta app configured for {product-title}.

.Procedure
. On the RHACS portal, navigate to *Platform Configuration* -> *Access Control*.
. Open the *Add an Auth Provider* menu and select *SAML 2.0*.
. Fill out the details for:
** *Integration Name:* A name to identify this authentication provider, for example, *Okta* or *Google*. The integration name is shown on the login page to help users select the right sign-in option.
** *ServiceProvider Issuer:* The value you are using as the `Audience URI` or `SP Entity ID` in Okta, or a similar value in other providers.
** *IdP Metadata URL:* Use the URL of *Identity Provider metadata* available from your identity provider console.
If you do not want to use the *IdP Metadata URL*, you can instead copy the required static fields from the *View Setup Instructions* link in the Okta console, or a similar location for other providers.
. Choose a *Minimum access role* for users accessing {product-title} by using the selected identity provider.

[TIP]
====
Set the *Minimum access role* to *Admin* while you complete setup.
Later, you can return to the *Access Control* page to set up more tailored access rules based on user metadata from your identity provider.
====
. Click *Save*.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If your SAML identity provider's authentication response:

* Includes a `NotValidAfter` assertion, the user session remains valid until the time specified in the `NotValidAfter` field has elapsed.
After its expiry, users must re-authenticate.
* Does not include a `NotValidAfter` assertion, the user session remains valid for 30 days, after which, the users must re-authenticate.
====

.Verification

. On the RHACS portal, navigate to *Platform Configuration* -> *Access Control*.
. Select the *Auth Provider Rules* tab.
. Under the *Auth Providers* section, select the authentication provider that you want to verify the configuration for.
. Select *Test Login* from the *Auth Provider* section header.
The *Test Login* page opens in a new browser tab.
. Sign in with your credentials.
** On success, {product-title} shows the `User ID` and `User Attributes` the identity provider sent for the credentials you have used to log in.
** On failure, {product-title} shows a message describing why the identity provider's response could not be processed.
. Close the *Test Login* browser tab.
