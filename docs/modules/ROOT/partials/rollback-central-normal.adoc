= Rolling back Central normally

[role="_abstract"]
You can roll back to a previous version of Central if upgrading {product-title} fails.

.Prerequisites

* You must be using {product-title} 3.0.57.0 or higher.
* Before you can perform a rollback, you must have free disk space available on your persistent storage. {product-title} uses disk space to keep a copy of databases during the upgrade. If the disk space is not enough to store a copy and the upgrade fails, you will not be able to roll back to an earlier version.

.Procedure

* Run the following command to roll back to a previous version when an upgrade fails (before the Central service starts):
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n stackrox rollout undo deploy/central
