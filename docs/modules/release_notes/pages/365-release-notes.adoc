[id="important-bug-fixes"]
== Important bug fixes

* *ROX-6988*: Previously, {product-title} did not delete the CVEs and did not update the advisory when some Red Hat packages that transitioned from unfixable to a fixable state.
* *ROX-7170*: Previously, {product-title} only collected the error logs in the diagnostic bundle if you have installed {product-title} services in the `stackrox` namespace.
* *ROX-7861*: Previously, {product-title} compliance control NIST 800-190 Control 4.1.4 did not correctly detect policies used for secrets protection.

[id="resolved-in-version-3651"]
=== Resolved in version 3.65.1

Release date: September 22, 2021

* *ROX-8008*: Previously, you could not use URN-based IdP Issuers while configuring SAML identity providers. This has been fixed.
* *ROX-8033*: Due to how {product-title} previously addressed its internal service endpoints, OpenShift clusters with enabled proxy failed to download the correct kernel probes.
* *ROX-8034*: Previously, if you were using backported 5.11 kernels for Ubuntu 20.04, the Collector sometimes failed on upgrade due to a change in the Ubuntu kernel build.

[id="important-system-changes"]
== Important system changes

* {product-title} 3.65 includes the updated `host-pid` policy, which adds an exception for the `openshift-sdn` namespace because the `sdn` deployment in the `openshift-sdn` namespace shares the host process namespace, and it resulted in an inaccurate violation.
* The alert notification titles for PagerDuty, Slack, Microsoft Teams, JIRA, and email notifiers now include the cluster and the policy names in addition to the deployment or image name if it exists.
* The alert notification for PagerDuty now includes the full alert in the JSON format as a custom detail.
* All default policy criteria for security policies are now read-only. However, you can still edit the policy criteria fields for the custom policies or policies you create by cloning a system policy.

[id="upcoming-changes"]
== Upcoming changes

* In {product-title} 3.66, Red Hat will deprecate the following default security policies:

** `DockerHub NGINX 1.10`
** `Shellshock: Multiple CVEs`
** `Heartbleed: CVE-2014-0160`

* In {product-title} 3.66, Red Hat will disable the following default security policy:
** `DOCKER CIS 4.4: Ensure images are scanned and rebuilt to include security patches`

You can create custom policies to monitor for these violations.
