== Important bug fixes

* *ROX-5397*, *ROX-6458*, and *ROX-6619*: Fixed a minor issue in the *Iptables Executed in Privileged Container* security policy, updated the remediation instructions in the *Curl in Image* security policy, and updated the *Kubernetes Dashboard Deployed* policy criteria.

The connection would fail with the *implicit grant not allowed for this client* error message.

* *ROX-6820*: Previously, {product-title} would not report CVEs in Distroless images under certain conditions.

* *ROX-6887*: Previously, the admission controller enforcement would not work for deploy-time policies if you were using `enforceOnUpdates`.
