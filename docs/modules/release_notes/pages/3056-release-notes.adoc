[id="new-features"]
== New features

[id="host-scanning"]
=== Host scanning

You can now identify vulnerabilities in core Kubernetes components and the container runtimes (Docker, CRI-O, runC, and containerd) you are using on your nodes.
//See link:/docs/manage-vulnerabilities/#identify-vulnerabilities-in-nodes[Identify vulnerabilities in nodes] for more information.

[id="network-baseline-updates"]
=== Network baseline updates

{product-title} discovers your deployments' network flows and creates a baseline based on the regular network activity in your clusters.
You can now configure alerts and block network activity for connections that do not exist in the baseline.
//For more information, see link:/docs/manage-network-policies/#use-network-baselining[Use Network baselining].

[id="important-bug-fixes"]
== Important bug fixes

* *ROX-3893*: Previously, if you used the `--json` option with the `roxctl image check` command, it would always exit with code `0`.

* *ROX-6085*: Fixed some issues with the `roxctl` CLIs logging and debugging commands.
* *ROX-6282*: Fixed the incorrect API description for `CountDeployments` and added missing descriptions for the `GetSecret`, `CountSecrets`, and `ListSecrets` endpoints.
* *ROX-6303*: Previously, the *Deployment With Most Severe Violations* widget in the *Vulnerability Management* view did not change based on the selected namespace.

* *ROX-6388*: Previously, the `sensor.sh` script would fail with errors when installing Sensor on {ocp} version 4.6 by using that script.

* *ROX-6504*: Previously, the RHACS portal would forcefully log out users when they selected *Platform Configuration* -> *Access Control*, and they did not have appropriate permissions.

* *ROX-6522*: Fixed an issue in the RHACS portal where the component's location would not display if you were viewing details for a specific image.
* *ROX-6540*: Previously, when configuring a SAML identity provider, the *IdP Metadata URL* option did not work for Keycloak.

* *ROX-6608*: Fixed incorrect authorization permissions for the `GetNetworkGraphConfig` and `PutNetworkGraphConfig` APIs.

[id="resolved-in-version-30561"]
=== Resolved in version 3.0.56.1

*Release date:* Mar 8, 2021

* *ROX-6629*: Fixed an issue in the RHACS portal, where the *Compliance* view would sometimes display an error message.
* *ROX-6708*: Previously, the Scanner would fail to scan images with OCI (Open Container Initiative) manifests.

* *ROX-6699*: Previously, modifying the *Docker CIS 5.15: Ensure that the host's process namespace is not shared* policy would result in an error.

* *ROX-6716*: Previously, if you used Helm to install Sensor, you could not enable automatic upgrades for that secured cluster.
You can now use the `SENSOR_HELM_NOT_HELM_MANAGED=true` environment variable to enable automatic upgrades for Helm managed secured clusters.

[id="known-issue"]
== Known Issue

* CVE-2020-28928 discovered in alpine:3.13 is a false positive.
This is actively being addressed.

[id="important-system-changes"]
== Important system changes

* Splunk alert events sent to HEC no longer include policy description, remediation, and rationale to allow for more violations within the HEC limit.
* Added *Namespace* and *Node* to the minimal access specification for creating a new *Role*.
* Added *Admission Control health status* to the health dashboard.
Navigate to *Platform Configuration* -> *System Health* to view.

[id="violation-policies"]
=== Violation policies

* Updated the *Improper Usage of Orchestrator Secrets Volume* policy to match the Dockerfile line syntax accurately.
* Updated the *Network Management Execution* policy to match network management utilities correctly.
* Added new default policies for the following CIS Docker controls:
** 4.1
** 4.4
** 4.7
** 5.1
** 5.7
** 5.9
** 5.15
** 5.16
** 5.19
** 5.20
** 5.21

[id="rhacs-portal"]
=== RHACS portal

The page title you see in your browser (and in your browser history) now displays the title of the page you are viewing.

[id="saml-authentication"]
=== SAML authentication

* If you are using the *Dynamic configuration* option, you can now specify the `https+insecure://` scheme for `IdP Metadata URL`.
When you use this option, {product-title} skips TLS validation when fetching the metadata.
This configuration is insecure, and Red Hat does not recommend using it.
* If you are using the *Static configuration* option, you can now specify multiple PEM-encoded certificates for the `IdP Certificate(s) (PEM)` option.

[id="roxctl-cli"]
=== roxctl CLI

* You can now use the new `--categories` option with the `roxctl image check` command and specify a comma-separated list of categories to only run policies that match the specified categories.
* You can now use the new `--json-fail-on-policy-violations` option with the `roxctl image check` command.
When you set this option to `true`, and there are policy violations, the command exits with a non-zero exit code.
The default value for this option is `false`.
* Red Hat plans to deprecate the `--json` option for the `roxctl image check` command in {product-title} 3.0.59; use the `--json-fail-on-policy-violations` option instead.
