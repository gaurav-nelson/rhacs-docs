{product-title} 3.0.57 includes feature enhancements, bug fixes, scale improvements, and other changes.

*Release date:* March 18, 2021

[id="new-features"]
== New features

[id="scan-inactive-images"]
=== Scan inactive images

{product-title} scans all active (deployed) images every 4 hours and updates the image scan results to reflect the latest vulnerability definitions.
You can now add inactive (undeployed) images for automatic scanning.
//For more details, see link:/docs/manage-vulnerabilities/#scan-inactive-images[Scan inactive images].
[id="important-bug-fixes"]
== Important bug fixes

* *ROX-6085*: Previously, setting Central log level by using the `roxctl` CLI's `debug log` command would not work sometimes.
You could also set unacceptable values for log level (for example, `Trace`), which did not affect the log level.

* *ROX-6302*: Loading too many violations on the *Violations* view would sometimes crash the RHACS portal page.

* *ROX-6627*: Previously, on {ocp}, when creating new builds, the {ocp} web console would show the error message  *admission webhook "policyeval.stackrox.io" does not support dry run*.
{product-title} now includes dry run support for the admission controller webhook.

* *ROX-6640*: The RHACS portal would not display the full description for RHSA CVEs in the *CVE* details view.
* *ROX-6723*: Previously, if you were using the default CA certificate for Central, and you configured an additional CA certificate for Sensor, {product-title} would overwrite Sensor's additional certificate.

* *ROX-6736*: Previously, sometimes the RHACS portal did not show allowed connections between Sensor and non-isolated deployments in the *Network Graph*  view.

[id="resolved-in-version-30571"]
=== Resolved in version 3.0.57.1

Release date: Mar 24, 2021

* *ROX-6832*: Previously, if you were using the RHEL base image, upgrading {product-title} to version 3.0.57.0 would fail.

[id="resolved-in-version-30572"]
=== Resolved in version 3.0.57.2

Release date: Mar 25, 2021

* *ROX-6834*:  Previously, in {product-title} 3.0.57.0, you could not install Sensor using the RHACS portal because downloading the Sensor bundle would fail.

* *ROX-6805*: Previously, if you were using {product-title} on {ocp}, the security context constraint link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1824800[conflicted with the Authentication Operator].
{product-title} now includes an updated security context constraint which fixes this issue.
To upgrade to {product-title} 3.0.57.2, you must also update the security context constraint.
//See  link:/docs/upgrade-stackrox/from-44/#update-openshift-security-context-constraints[Update {ocp} Security Context Constraints]  for details.

[id="important-system-changes"]
== Important system changes

* You can now declare custom `SourceTypes` for alert and audit events if you are integrating with Splunk.
* The published time for CVEs in RHEL and CentOS images is now correctly shown.
* You can now use cluster init bundles for clusters you have deployed with `helmManaged` set to `false`.
Previously, `helmManaged=false` only worked with certificates that were specific to an existing cluster.

[id="roxctl-cli"]
=== roxctl CLI

The `roxctl central generate openshift` and `roxctl sensor generate openshift` commands now accept an `--openshift-version` option.
You can set it to:

* 3 if you are deploying on {ocp} version `3.x`, or
* 4 if you are deploying on {ocp} version `4.x`.

When you do not specify this option, {product-title} generates deployment bundles in a compatibility mode that works on {ocp} version `3.11` and version `4.x`.
However, if you are using {ocp} version `4.x`, Red Hat recommends that you specify this options as `4` to take advantage of additional features that are not available for earlier {ocp} versions.

[id="security-updates"]
== Security updates

{product-title} includes an updated Collector image which resolve the following fixable CVEs:

* link:https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-24031[CVE-2021-24031]
* link:https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-24032[CVE-2021-24032]

The Collector image version `3.1.16-latest` includes this update.
