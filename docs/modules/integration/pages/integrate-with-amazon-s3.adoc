You can integrate {product-title} with link:https://aws.amazon.com/s3/[Amazon S3] to enable data backups.
You can use these backups for data restoration in the case of an infrastructure disaster or corrupt data.
After you integrate with Amazon S3, you can schedule daily or weekly backups and do manual on-demand backups.

The backup includes the entire {product-title} database, which includes all configurations, resources, events, and certificates.
Make sure that backups are stored securely.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* If you are using {product-title} version 3.0.53 or older, the backup does not include certificates.
* If your Amazon S3 is part of an air-gapped environment, you must add your AWS root CA as a xref:configuration:add-trusted-ca.adoc[trusted certificate authority] in {product-title}.
