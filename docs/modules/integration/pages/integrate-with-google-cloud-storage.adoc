You can integrate with link:https://cloud.google.com/storage/[Google Cloud Storage (GCS)] to enable data backups.
You can use these backups for data restoration in the case of an infrastructure disaster, or corrupt data.
After you integrate with GCS, you can schedule daily or weekly backups and do manual on-demand backups.

The backup includes the {product-title} entire database, which includes all configurations, resources, events, and certificates.
Make sure that backups are stored securely.

[NOTE]
====
If you are using {product-title} version 3.0.53 or older, the backup does not include certificates.
