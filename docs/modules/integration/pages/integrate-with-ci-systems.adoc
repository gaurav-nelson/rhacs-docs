{product-title} (RHACS) integrates with a variety of continuous integration (CI) products and allows you to apply build-time and deploy-time security rules before you deploy images.

{product-title} integrates into CI pipelines after images are built and pushed to a registry.
Pushing the image first allows developers to continue testing their artifacts while dealing with any policy violations alongside any other CI test failures, linter violations, or other problems.

If possible, you should configure the version control system to block pull or merge requests from being merged if the build stage, which includes {product-title} checks, fails.

The integration with your CI product functions by contacting your {product-title} installation to check whether the image complies with build-phase policies you have configured.
If there are policy violations, a detailed message is displayed on the console log, including the policy description, rationale, and remediation instructions.
Each policy includes an optional enforcement setting;
if you mark a policy for build-phase enforcement, failure of that policy causes the client to exit with a nonzero error code.

To integrate {product-title} with your CI system, follow these steps:

. xref:../integration/integrate-with-ci-systems.adoc#configure-registry-integration[Configure a registry integration].
. xref:../integration/integrate-with-ci-systems.adoc#configure-access[Configure access] to your {product-title} instance.

[id="configure-build-policies"]
== Configuring build policies

To check {product-title} policies during builds, you must first configure policies that apply to the build phase of the container lifecycle. And then you must integrate with the registry that images are pushed to during the build.

include::ROOT:partial$create-new-system-policy.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

[id="configure-registry-integration"]
== Configuring registry integration

To scan images, you must provide {product-title} with access to the image registry you are using in your build pipeline.

[id="configure-access"]
== Configuring access

{product-title} provides a command-line interface (CLI) `roxctl` to make it easy to integrate {product-title} policies into your build pipeline.
The `roxctl` CLI prints detailed information about problems and how to fix them so that developers can maintain high standards in the early phases of the container lifecycle.

To securely authenticate to the {product-title} API server, you must create an API token.

[id="install-roxctl-cli-binary"]
=== Installing the roxctl CLI by downloading the binary

You can install the `roxctl` CLI to interact with {product-title} from a
command-line interface. You can install `roxctl` on Linux, Windows, or macOS.

[id="integrate-with-your-ci-pipeline"]
== Integrating with your CI pipeline

After you have finished these procedures, the next step is to integrate with your CI pipeline.

Each CI system might require a slightly different configuration.

[id="using-jenkins"]
=== Using Jenkins

Use the link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/stackrox-container-image-scanner[StackRox Container Image Scanner] Jenkins plugin for integrating with Jenkins.
You can use this plugin in both Jenkins freestyle projects and pipelines.
