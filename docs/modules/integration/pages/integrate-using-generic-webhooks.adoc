With {product-title}, you can send alert notifications as JSON messages to any webhook receiver.
When a violation occurs, {product-title} makes an HTTP POST request on the configured URL.
The POST request body includes JSON-formatted information about the alert.

The webhook POST request's JSON data includes a `v1.Alert` object and any custom fields that you configure, as shown in the following example:

[source,json]
----
{
  "alert": {
    "id": "<id>",
    "time": "<timestamp>",
    "policy": {
      "name": "<name>",
      ...
    },
    ...
  },
  "<custom_field_1>": "<custom_value_1>"
}
----

You can create multiple webhooks.
For example, you can create one webhook for receiving all audit logs and another webhook for alert notifications.

To forward alerts from {product-title} to any webhook receiver:

. Set up a webhook URL to receive alerts.
. Use the webhook URL to set up notifications in {product-title}.
. Identify the policies you want to send notifications for, and update the notification settings for those policies.
