[role="_abstract"]
With {product-title} you can analyze images for vulnerabilities.
Scanner analyzes all image layers to check for known vulnerabilities by comparing them with the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) list.

When Scanner finds any vulnerabilities, it:

* Shows them in the xref:operating:manage-vulnerabilities.adoc#vulnerability-management-view_acs-operating-manage-vulnerabilities[*Vulnerability Management*] view for detailed analysis.
* Ranks vulnerabilities according to risk and highlights them in the RHACS portal for risk assessment.
* Checks them against enabled xref:operating:manage-security-policies.adoc#manage-security-policies[security policies].

Scanner inspects the images and identifies the installed components based on the files in the images.
It may fail to identify installed components or vulnerabilities if the final images are modified to remove the following files:
