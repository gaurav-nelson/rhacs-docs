{product-title} allows you to use out-of-the-box security policies and define custom multi-factor policies for your container environment.
Configuring these policies enables you to automatically prevent high-risk service deployments in your environment and respond to runtime security incidents.

== Creating custom policies

In addition to using the default policies, you can also create custom policies in {product-title}.

To build a new policy, you can clone an existing policy or create a new one from scratch.

* You can also create policies based on the filter criteria in the *Risk* view in the RHACS portal.
* You can also use `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` logical operators for policy criteria to create advanced policies.

[id="share-security-policies"]
== Sharing security policies

Beginning from {product-title} version 3.0.44,  you can share your security policies between different Central instances, by exporting and importing policies.
It helps you enforce the same standards for all your clusters.
To share policies, you export them as JSON files, and then import them back into another Central instance.

[NOTE]
====
Currently, you cannot export multiple security policies at once by using the RHACS portal.
However, you can use the API for exporting multiple security policies.
On the RHACS portal, navigate to *Help* -> *API reference* to see the API reference.
