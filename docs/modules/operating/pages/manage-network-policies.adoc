[role="_abstract"]
A https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/[Kubernetes network policy] is a specification of how groups of pods are allowed to communicate with each other and other network endpoints.
These network policies are configured as YAML files.
By looking at these files alone, it is often hard to identify whether the applied network policies achieve the desired network topology.

{product-title} gathers all defined network policies from your orchestrator and provides functionality to make these policies easier to use.

To support network policy enforcement, {product-title} provides:

* Network graph
* Network policy simulator
* Network policy generator
