[role="_abstract"]
{product-title} (RHACS) comes with role-based access control (RBAC) that you can use to configure roles and grant various levels of access to {product-title} for different users.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are using {product-title} 3.0.62 or older, see xref:../../operating/manage-user-access/manage-role-based-access-control-3062.adoc#manage-rbac-3062[Managing access control in {product-title} 3.0.62 and older].
====

{product-title} 3.63 includes a scoped access control feature that enables you to configure fine-grained and specific sets of permissions that define how a given {product-title} user or a group of users can interact with {product-title}, which resources they can access, and which actions they can perform.

* _Roles_ are a collection of permission sets and access scopes. You can assign roles to users and groups by specifying rules. You can configure these rules when you configure an authentication provider.
There are two types of roles in {product-title}:
** System roles that are created by Red Hat and cannot be changed.
** Custom roles, which {product-title} administrators can create and change at any time.
+
[NOTE]
====
* If you assign multiple roles for a user, they get access to the combined permissions of the assigned roles.
* If you have users assigned to a custom role, and you delete that role, all associated users transfer to the minimum access role that you have configured.
====

* _Permission sets_ are a set of permissions that define what actions a role can perform on a given resource. _Resources_ are the functionalities of {product-title} for which you can set view (`read`) and modify (`write`) permissions. There are two types of permission sets in {product-title}:
** System permission sets, which are created by Red Hat and cannot be changed.
** Custom permission sets, which {product-title} administrators can create and change at any time.

* _Access scopes_ are a set of Kubernetes and {ocp} resources that users can access. For example, you can define an access scope that only allows users to access information about pods in a given project. There are two types of access scopes in {product-title}:
** System access scopes, which are created by Red Hat and cannot be changed.
** Custom access scopes, which {product-title} administrators can create and change at any time.
