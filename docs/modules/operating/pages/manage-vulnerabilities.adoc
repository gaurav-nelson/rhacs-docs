Security vulnerabilities in your environment may allow attackers to gain unauthorized access or perform unauthorized actions.
Therefore, managing vulnerabilities is a critical step in protecting your environment.
It involves identifying, classifying, reporting, prioritizing, remediating, and mitigating security vulnerabilities.

{product-title} (RHACS) enables you to identify and prioritize vulnerabilities for quick remediation.

== Using comments and tags

You can use tags and comments to specify what is happening with violations to keep your team up to date.
Comments allow you to add text notes to violations and tags allow you to categorize your violations.

[id="snooze-and-unsnooze-cves"]
== Snoozing and unsnoozing CVEs

If you determine that certain CVEs do not relate to your infrastructure for the moment, you can snooze those CVEs.
Later, when the CVEs are relevant, you can unsnooze those CVEs.
You can also snooze CVEs for a certain amount of time, such as a day, a week, two weeks, a month, or indefinitely (until you unsnooze).

When you snooze a CVE, {product-title} stops showing that CVE in widgets and other views and ignores its impact on your environment.
If the snoozed CVE is part of a policy and if all the CVEs in that policy are snoozed, the policy does not generate a violation.
When you unsnooze or the specified time lapses,  the CVEs start showing up again as usual, and the policy violations resume.
