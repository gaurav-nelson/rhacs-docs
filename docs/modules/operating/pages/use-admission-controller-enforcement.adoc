[role="_abstract"]
{product-title} works with https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/[Kubernetes admission controllers] and https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.5/architecture/admission-plug-ins.html[{ocp} admission plug-ins] to allow you to enforce security policies before Kubernetes or {ocp} creates workloads, for example, deployments, daemon sets or jobs.
The {product-title} admission controller prevents users from creating workloads that violate policies you configure in {product-title}.
Beginning from the {product-title} version 3.0.41, you can also configure the admission controller to prevent updates to workloads that violate policies.

{product-title} uses the `ValidatingAdmissionWebhook` controller to verify that the resource being provisioned complies with the specified security policies.
To handle this, {product-title} creates a `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration` which contains multiple webhook rules.
When the Kubernetes or {ocp} API server receives a request that matches one of the webhook rules, the API server sends an `AdmissionReview` request to {product-title}.
{product-title} then accepts or rejects the request based on the configured security policies.

[NOTE]
====
To use admission controller enforcement on {ocp}, you need the {product-title}  version 3.0.49 or newer.

== Enabling admission controller enforcement

If you intend to use admission controller enforcement, consider the following:

* *API latency*: Using admission controller enforcement increases Kubernetes  or {ocp} API latency because it involves additional API validation requests.
Many standard Kubernetes libraries, such as fabric8, have short Kubernetes or {ocp} API timeouts by default.
Also, consider API timeouts in any custom automation you might be using.
* *Image scanning*: You can choose whether the admission controller scans images while reviewing requests by setting the *Contact Image Scanners* option in the cluster configuration panel.
** If you enable this setting, {product-title} contacts image scanners if scan results are not already available, which adds considerable latency.
** If you disable this setting, the enforcement decision only considers image scan criteria if cached scan results are available.
*** For {product-title} version 3.0.41 and newer, the cached scan results are only available for images referenced by their image digest (`+@sha256:...+`).
* You can use admission controller enforcement for:
** Options in the pod `securityContext`.
** Deployment configurations.
** Image components and vulnerabilities.
* You cannot use admission controller enforcement for:
** Any runtime behavior, such as processes.
** Any policies based on port exposure.
* The admission controller might fail if there are connectivity issues between the Kubernetes or {ocp} API server and {product-title} Sensor.
To resolve this issue, delete the `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration` object as described in the disabling admission controller enforcement section.
//link to Disable admission controller enforcement
* If you have deploy-time enforcement enabled for a policy and you enable the admission controller, {product-title} attempts to block deployments that violate the policy.
If a noncompliant deployment slips past the admission controller, for example, in case of a timeout, {product-title} still applies other deploy-time enforcement mechanisms, such as scaling to zero replicas.
