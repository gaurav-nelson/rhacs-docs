Using {product-title} you can view policy violations, drill down to the actual cause of the violation, and take corrective actions.

{product-title} built-in policies identify a variety of security findings, including vulnerabilities (CVEs), violations of DevOps best practices, high-risk build and deployment practices, and suspicious runtime behaviors.
Whether you use the default out-of-box security policies or use your own custom policies, {product-title} reports a violation when an enabled policy fails.
