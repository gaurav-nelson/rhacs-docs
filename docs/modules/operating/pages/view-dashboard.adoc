The {product-title} (RHACS) dashboard enables you to visually track and analyze key metrics such as risk across your environment, compliance status, and policy violations.
The *Dashboard* view helps you to understand your cloud-native infrastructure, including images, containers, pods, namespaces, clusters, and their configurations.

[NOTE]
====
When you open the RHACS portal for the first time, you might see a blank dashboard.
After you deploy Sensor in at least one cluster, the dashboard reflects the status of your environment.
====

The *Dashboard* view includes multiple interactive widgets which show a summary of system violations, summary of compliance status, violations by cluster, top risky deployments, and active violations.
It also includes other widgets that are automatically generated when you create new policy categories.
